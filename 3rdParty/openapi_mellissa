Covering over 240+ different countries and territories around the world, this service allows you to ensure your address data is clean and accurate. Additionally, you can also parse the data and append latitude and longitude.\n\n![Global Address Verification Flowchart](http://wiki.melissadata.com/images/9/93/EXT_QSG_Diagram_GlobalAddressVerification.png \"Global Address Verification Flowchart\")\n\n#### You can use Global Address Verification to:\n  * Verify and correct addresses.\n  * Return the address parsed into individual components.\n  * Append latitude and longitude.\n  * Transliterate the address from or into the native language of the input country.\n  * Get the address formatted for mailing labels.\n  \n## Field Names\nThis is a list of the request field names and their protocol naming conventions.\n\n| Field Name | REST | JSON/XML\n| ---------- | ---- | --------\n| Transmission Reference | t | TransmissionReference\n| License Key | id | CustomerID\n| Options | opt | Options\n| Format | format | Format\n| Record ID |  | RecordID\n| Organization | org | Organization\n| Address Line 1 | a1 | AddressLine1\n| Address Line 2 | a2 | AddressLine2\n| Address Line 3 | a3 | AddressLine3\n| Address Line 4 | a4 | AddressLine4\n| Address Line 5 | a5 | AddressLine5\n| Address Line 6 | a6 | AddressLine6\n| Address Line 7 | a7 | AddressLine7\n| Address Line 8 | a8 | AddressLine8\n| Double Dependent Locality | ddeploc | DoubleDependentLocality\n| Dependent Locality | deploc | DependentLocality\n| Locality | loc | Locality\n| Sub Administrative Area | subadmarea | SubAdministrativeArea\n| Administrative Area | admarea | AdministrativeArea\n| Postal Code | postal | PostalCode\n| Sub National Area | subnatarea | SubNationalArea\n| Country | ctry | Country\n\n## Options\nOptions allow you to make configuration changes to modify the output. This field is options, and they are passed in the format of `OptionName:Setting`. You can specify none, one, or more options at the same time by delimiting with a `,`(comma). For example: `OutputScript:LATN,DeliveryLines:ON,LineSeparator:Pipe`\n\n#### DeliveryLines:(on,off)\nThis options allows you to specify if the Address Lines 1-8 should contain just the delivery address or the entire address. Default of \"off\" will have address lines 1-8 return the entire address.\n\n#### LineSeparator:(SEMICOLON,PIPE,CR,LF,CRLF,TAB,BR)\nThis is the line separator used for the FormattedAddress result.\n\n| Parameter | Description\n| --------- | -----------\n| SEMICOLON | Default.

This is necessary for including with each request to Global Address Verification. This value should be put into the License Key element in each Web service request.\nIf you do not have a License Key, please contact your Melissa sales representative at 1-800-MELISSA (1-800-635-4772).\n\n## Single vs. Batch\nMelissa cloud services are capable of both single record real-time processing and batch processing. The difference is simply in the number of records sent in each request. Melissa cloud services take an array of records. This array can contain anything from one to one hundred records. For a real-time process like a web form entry or a call center application, send in a request with one record. For a batch processing scenario like a database, send requests of up to 100 records until all the records are processed. Note: Make sure each record in the request has a unique Record ID.\n\n## Choosing a Web Service Protocol\nThe Melissa Global Address Verification web service supports REST and JSON. For the undecided, here are some Pros and Cons of one Web Service protocol over the other.\n\n#### REST\n**_Pros:_** REST is lightweight and relies upon HTTP to do its work. If you don't need a strict API definition, this is the way to go. REST is also format-agnostic so you can use XML or JSON as responses.\n\n**_Cons:_** REST can only be used for sending of single records and doesn’t support strict contracts or more involved security. The Response is a JSON document.\n\n#### JSON\n**_Pros:_** JSON relies on simple object serialization based on JavaScript’s object initialization. It is very simple to use with JavaScript and easily parsed and understood by developers.\n\n**_Cons:_** No support for formal definitions. No namespace support. Not much support in Web Service clients with some platforms.\n\n## Basic Order of Operations (Pseudo Code)\n1. Create a request using the pre-defined structure in SOAP, XML, or JSON.\n2. Fill in the request with your license or customer ID.\n3. Add address records to the <Records> array with anywhere from 1 to 100 <RequestRecord> items.\n4. Send the request to the service using the SOAP endpoint for SOAP requests and the WEB endpoint for XML or JSON requests and receive a response back.\n5. Parse the response and the results.\n\n## Interpreting Results\nMelissa's Global Address Service uses Results Codes to determine if an address is good or bad.\nThe following Results conventions are used:\n* Cloud Service Errors: SExx\n* Cloud Transmission Errors: GExx\n* Address Status Codes: AVxx\n* Address Error Codes: AExx\n* Address Change Codes: ACxx\n\nThe most important codes are the AV codes. The will tell you if the address we give back to you is good (and how good) or bad. The first digit can be a 1 (partially validated) or 2 (fully validated). The 2nd digit is to what level the address is validated to. The possible values are:\n- administrative area\n- locality\n- thoroughfare\n- premises\n- subpremise\n\nFor a country with good reference data like the US, a fully good address would be AV24 (a house) or AV25 (an apartment). Not every country has house number or subpremise data available. For a country with thoroughfare level data only, the maximum verification status is AV23 (thoroughfare). \n\nFor more details, see the [Global Address Verification Wiki](http://wiki.melissadata.com/index.php?title=Global_Address_Verification)\n\n## Result Codes\nThe service returns a series of result codes to tell you of the status of the Address and any changes or errors found during the verification process.\n\nFor a full list of the Result Codes returned by the Global Address Verification, see [Global Address Verification Result Codes](http://wiki.melissadata.com/index.php?title=Result_Code_Details#Global_Address_Verification)\n\n## Wiki Page\nA product support Wiki is available for your convenience. In the Wiki, you will find documentation about the service in more detail.\n\n[Global Address Verification Wiki Page](http://wiki.melissadata.com/index.php?title=Global_Address_Verification)\n\n# Misc. Considerations\n## Firewall\nIf you are behind a firewall, you may need to allow specific IP addresses access in order to communicate with the service.\n\nFor a full list of IP Addresses, see [IP Address Information](http://wiki.melissadata.com/index.php?title=IP_Address_Information)\n","contact":{"name":"Melissa Corp.","url":"http://melissadata.com/company/contact.htm"}},"externalDocs":{"description":"Global Address Verification Wiki","url":"http://wiki.melissadata.com/index.php?title=Global_Address_Verification"},"host":"address.melissadata.net","basePath":"/v3/WEB","schemes":["http","https"],"consumes":["application/json"],"produces":["application/json"],"responses":{"SuccessResponse":{"description":"A response is the result of a request.
